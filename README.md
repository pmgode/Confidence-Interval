# Confidence-Interval
Simulation to calculate the throughput through the OMNET++ simulation tool and calculate Confidence interval.

This exercise will explain the importance of warmup period and confidence intervals for the evaluation of simulation results.

1] Simulate your network for 10 seconds, for 100 seconds and for 1000 seconds. After each run, have a look at the application layer throughput over time (Attention: Throughput should be computed as discussed in 
   Exercise 4). What do you notice at the beginning of the simulation? What does your observation mean for the data analysis?
2] Now repeat the simulation for 10 seconds 10 times with different seeds. What do you notice about the average application layer throughput?
3] Research and understand the concept of confidence intervals and how they are mathematically computed.
4] Calculate the confidence intervals for your simulation results from Task 2 using your preferred programming language (MATLAB, Python, â€¦). You can implement the calculations manually, or use built-in functions.
5] Also repeat the simulation runs with a duration of 100 seconds and 1000 seconds. Calculate the 95% confidence intervals for each simulation duration. Draw all results in one graph. What do you notice about the 
   confidence intervals?
6] What will happen if you repeat your simulations 30 times instead of 10 times?
